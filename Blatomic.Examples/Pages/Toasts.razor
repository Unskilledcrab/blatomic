    <p class="my-2 font-medium">
        Out toasts come pre-styled out of the box, however you can change the default styling be your own custom <b>RenderFragment</b> if you would like. 
        One huge benefit to this toast system is it will automatically set the time on screen for you <b>based on the content</b>. This means that
        if you place a large bit of content to show the user, it will stay on the screen for longer so that the user has time to read everything before
        it disappears.
